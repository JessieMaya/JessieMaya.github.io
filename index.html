            <h3> I adore you, there is no greater feeling in life than finding your other half. I'm so happy that we are spending this life together. Here is to many more years, months, days and hours together. Many more laughs, hugs, stupid jokes, random foods, fishing weekends, long drives that lead into long talks about the meaning of life and the hardships that go alongside it, here is to many more of everything I could ever dream up. I wouldn't want to experience it with anyone else.</h3>
